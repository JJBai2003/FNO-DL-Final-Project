We were fortunately able to use the dataset provided by the researchers directly with the approval from instructors. 
Theoretically, the data are generated by solving the 1d Burgers' Equation using the pseudo-spectral split-step method with s = 8192. 
The link to accessing the data can be found here: https://ssd.mathworks.com/supportfiles/nnet/data/burgers1d/burgers_data_R10.mat. 
To run the training and testing jupyter notebook file correctly, please put the data file inside the same directory.
